#  Pattern Programs in C++

This repository contains various **pattern printing programs** in C++.  
They are commonly asked in coding interviews to test **logic building, loops, and problem-solving skills**.

---

##  Folder Structure
- Each file corresponds to a specific pattern (e.g., `Pattern1.c++`, `Pattern2.c++`, etc.)
- Both **source code (`.c++`)** and compiled files (`.exe`) are present.  
  (Note: `.exe` files are generated after compilation and may not run on all systems.)
